I
make
stuff.


*Beautiful, practical, meaningful stuff.*


I make what I love.

*I love what I do.*


But over the years, I noticed that somehow, along the way, software designed to help us be creative, actually made us less creative. That's because we believe our best ideas emerge when we use pencils and paper.
So I set out to build tools that work the way I do.


Tools for the creative space — the 53 centimeters that magically link head, heart, and hand. Tools as simple as pencil and paper. Tools so essential, I  really can't imagine work without them.
